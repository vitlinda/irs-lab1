# Phototaxis
Program the robot such that it is able to perform phototaxis (i.e., it goes towards the
light). Arena: only perimetral walls and one light bulb. Suggestion: remove the floor
picture and all sensors and actuators that are not necessary for the task. Note that some
sensors depend on some features of the environment, e.g. the motor ground sensor needs
a floor picture, and the light sensors needs a light.
- Variant 1: add an extra light
- Variant 2: what happens if you add actuator/sensor noise?
