# Obstacle avoidance
Program the robot such that it is able to move randomly avoiding obstacles (this behaviour
is also called random walk with collision avoidance). Arena: perimetral walls and some
boxes. Test the robot in arenas with different number and shape of boxes.
- Variant 1: what happens if you add actuator/sensor noise?
- Variant 2: try with more robots (just use distribute and set quantity to a value
greater than 1)
